# Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1

The following patches are available for this game:

**Steam version support for DLC 01, 03 & 04**  
[neptunia_rebirth1_dlc_support_EN](neptunia_rebirth1_dlc_support_EN.patch)  
[neptunia_rebirth1_dlc_support_JP](neptunia_rebirth1_dlc_support_JP.patch)  
[neptunia_rebirth1_dlc_support_CN](neptunia_rebirth1_dlc_support_CN.patch)  
Adds support for the DLC content [Allowance], [DENGEKI PlayStation(R) Collaboration Costume Set] &
[DENGEKI PlayStation(R) Collaboration Costume Set, Part 2] to the steam version of the game.
These DLC aren't available on Steam and are thus normally just ignored when you launch the game,
even after adding them to your DLC folder. This patch changes that. Pick the right file for your game language.  
*Actual DLC files not included.*
